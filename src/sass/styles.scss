===== THEME STYLESHEET =====
=
= I've divvied up the scss to go from a wider scope to a more specific scope. ( As you would )
= The order that I have decided on is: global > module > component > layout
= For each one, I will explain my thinking as to why they are more specific than the last.
= Here is a link to something which explains my thinking on the mater, fairly well.

/* ==========================================================================
===== CORE STYLES =====
=
= These are for styles that will always be used. The rules here should be minimal and dry.
= When working on more specific classes and elements you don't want to have to backpedal very much, if at all.
= Don't see the need to add any more files to this folder, what is here should cover all the core needs.
